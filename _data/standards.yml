  title: Application-Level Profile Semantics (ALPS)
  name: Internet Draft amundsen-richardson-foster-alps
  URI: urn:ietf:id:amundsen-richardson-foster-alps
  URL: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-amundsen-richardson-foster-alps
  abstract: This document describes ALPS, a data format for defining simple descriptions
    of application-level semantics, similar in complexity to HTML microformats. An
    ALPS document can be used as a profile to explain the application semantics of
    a document with an application-agnostic media type (such as HTML, HAL, Collection+JSON,
    Siren, etc.). This increases the reusability of profile documents across media
    types.

  title: The Sunset HTTP Header
  name: Internet Draft wilde-sunset-header
  URI: urn:ietf:id:wilde-sunset-header
  URL: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-sunset-header
  abstract: This specification defines the Sunset HTTP response header field, which
    indicates that a URI is likely to become unresponsive at a specified point in
    the future. It also defines a sunset link relation type that allows linking to
    resources providing information about an upcoming resource or service sunset.

  title: The Item and Collection Link Relations
  name: RFC 6573
  URI: urn:ietf:rfc:6573
  URL: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6573
  abstract: RFC 5988 standardized a means of indicating the relationships between
    resources on the Web. This specification defines a pair of reciprocal link relation
    types that may be used to express the relationship between a collection and its
    members.

  title: Problem Details for HTTP APIs
  name: RFC 7807
  URI: urn:ietf:rfc:7807
  URL: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807
  abstract: This document defines a "problem detail" as a way to carry machine-readable
    details of errors in a HTTP response, to avoid the need to invent new error response
    formats for HTTP APIs.

  name: RFC6902
  body:
    short: IETF
    url: http://webconcepts.info/specs/IETF
  abstract: |
    JSON Patch defines a JSON document structure for expressing a
    sequence of operations to apply to a JavaScript Object Notation
    (JSON) document; it is suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH method.
    The "application/json-patch+json" media type is used to identify such
    patch documents.

  URL: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396
  name: RFC7396
  body:
    short: IETF
    url: http://webconcepts.info/specs/IETF
  abstract: |
    This specification defines the JSON merge patch format and processing
    rules.  The merge patch format is primarily intended for use with the
    HTTP PATCH method as a means of describing a set of modifications to
    a target resource's content.

    short: IETF
    url: http://webconcepts.info/specs/IETF
  abstract: |
    This document specifies relation types for Web links, and defines a
    registry for them.  It also defines the use of such links in HTTP
    headers with the Link header field.

- name: JSON Text Sequences
  ref: RFC7464
  url: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7464
  body: IETF
  status: complete
  abstract: |
   This document describes the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) text
   sequence format and associated media type "application/json-seq".  A
   JSON text sequence consists of any number of JSON texts, all encoded
   in UTF-8, each prefixed by an ASCII Record Separator (0x1E), and each
   ending with an ASCII Line Feed character (0x0A).
